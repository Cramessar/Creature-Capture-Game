# 🐉 Creature Capture Game

## 📝 Overview
The **Creature Capture Game** is a simple text-based game with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt5. It is designed to demonstrate basic programming skills, including object-oriented programming, event-driven programming, and creating interactive applications. The game draws inspiration from Pokémon-style mechanics, where players battle creatures, earn experience points, and level up.

This project serves as a showcase of programming knowledge and provides potential employers with a glimpse into the ability to create engaging, interactive applications.

## 🎮 Features
- **Creature Battles**: Players can encounter random creatures, use moves with unique attributes, and strategize battles.
- **Leveling System**: Creatures earn experience points (XP) after battles, enabling them to level up and improve their stats.
- **Elemental Type System**: A dynamic type chart determines the effectiveness of moves based on elemental types (e.g., fire vs. water).
- **Move Mechanics**:
  - Moves have varying damage, accuracy, and effects (e.g., guaranteed hits, powerful but inaccurate moves).
  - "Lucky hits" provide a chance for increased damage with animations.
- **Progress Bars**: Health bars visually represent the health of both the player's and the opponent's creatures.
- **Animations**: Visual effects for events like "Lucky Hits" and level-ups, enhancing the user experience.
- **Gil Rewards**: Players earn in-game currency (gil) for each victory.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
- **PyQt5 GUI**: The game features a responsive graphical user interface with buttons, labels, text areas, and progress bars.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Classes like `Creature` and `Move` encapsulate key game mechanics.
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Battles are randomized with scalable difficulty, providing a new experience with each playthrough.
- **Customizable Styles**: The game's appearance can be customized through a `styles.css` file.
- **Real-Time Animations**: Smooth animations for special events such as "Lucky Hit" stars and level-up banners.
